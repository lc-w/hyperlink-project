    <h2>A website where you can turn the ideas of others into a new work</h2>
    <h2>Draw it, Read it, Speak it and Share how your mind thinks.</h2>
        <p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlink</a> has changed how we share information and how we communicate online; a simple click on an underlined word can open a world of new ideas. A most democratic way to share ideas, so simple in its design, and all you need to do is type.  
            <br>

            <br>
        <br>The web has a current hierarchy of rankings by power and audience. What if it was organized by ideas? 
            <br>
        <br> Let me explain, vaguely :)
            <br>
            <br>I have a favourite essay by Joan Didion, called "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/12/05/archives/why-i-write-why-i-write.html">Why I Write</a>". She so eloquently explains how our minds' wander and how important this wandering is to connect ideas and hatch new ones. The lovely thought of trying to decode Hegel while instead intently focusing on a flowering pear tree and the particularity of how the petals fell to the floor. 
            <br>
        <br> Next she speaks of how in her mind's eye, images shimmer and even further, how grammar shimmers. This is how her internal writer is directed, from one shimmer to the next.
        <br>
        <br> Our ideas are fluid, and how we experience the world is vastly different from one person to the other. However we can learn more about the world by experiencing it through the eyes of others. And by listening to each others' connections. 
        <br>
